This is the central issue of Bitcoin’s skeptics. Bitcoin doesn’t scale, they say. But the scaling question is stupid. You don’t understand what’s going on here if you think it matters. Let me explain why.

Bitcoin is highly versatile. Bitcoin’s network, itself, doesn’t need to scale to a trillion billion transactions per second. As Bitcoin grows, as it institutionalises, there is a clear reality that Bitcoiners are going to have to accept. It’s a settlement engine. I didn’t coin the phrase. I believe that Greg Maxwell called Bitcoin a settlement engine in the Bitcoin core mailing list. But that’s what it is. To the chagrin of Bitcoin Cash users, this is what a blockchain has to be. Blockchains don’t scale. They never will. They don’t need to.

What has happened, what will continue to happen, and what I have always said is that Bitcoin mainstreamification will bring in institutions. This is where the stupidity of Bitcoin’s most ardent anarchic libertarians get off the train. The Antonopoulos’s of the world didn’t see this very obvious reality. And the fact that they didn’t is a blindness that probably is responsible for the Blockchain warring we are all familiar with. Centralised institutions aren’t evil. They are simply amoral. And they come with a lot of experience.

So to the question, how do you get Bitcoin to do as many transactions as VISA and Mastercard? The answer is, you put them on VISA and Mastercard. A centralized rail will allow Bitcoins to move at the speed of light within the same database that VISA and Mastercard manage their own financial transactions. This comes at the cost of privacy. But most people aren’t looking for encrypted privacy in all their transactions. Buying a sandwich or a coffee doesn’t need it. How do you get institutions to begin accepting stable coins? You create a clearinghouse for that money. You net each day, and you hit a single central database. You don’t need lightning to scale. You need institutions. Lightning is a great fallback. But it isn’t necessarily the answer. At least not in the immediate moment. The answer, at this time, is institutions. Institutions scale Bitcoin. And institutions carry with them the most important part of scaling a financial network: liability. If they lose your money, you can sue them. You can get your money back from them through the legal system.

So do you get it now? The world of decentralised finance is dependent on institutions. And the bigger Bitcoin gets, the more centralised institutions become dependent on it. Bitcoin will not recreate finance. Rather, traditional finance will recreate the way that we use it by wrapping their millennia of experience in clearing, settlement, and more onto the industry. And that’s a good thing Bitcoiners. Embrace it. If you don’t like it, then keep your bitcoins out of the institutions. But for the normies, that’s the only way to get them onboard. Don’t begrudge them their technophobia. Don’t foist your ideology of decentralisation on to them. Just sit back and enjoy the adoption.
