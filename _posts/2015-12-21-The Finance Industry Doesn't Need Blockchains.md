![Blockchain cures what ails you!](/assets/snakeoil.jpg)

If you wanted to understand the state of private blockchains in 2015, you need only observe the discussions that took place on Day 1 of the SWIFT Innotribe conference at Sibos 2015.

During this "Blockchain session" a large group of finance industry professionals and "blockchain experts" agreed that blockchains were the wave of the future – despite a complete lack of consensus on what a blockchain is, or why one is even needed.

With every year comes a new audience fresh to the field with ambitions to solve all the problems of our day with blockchain. Common to nearly all of this year's pitches are the efficiencies this can bring to the process of "notarisation".

If you read through the marketing brochures for these private ledger companies, you would discover this magical new technology performs data-checksumming at blistering speeds and in ways that were previously encumbering the entirety of the modern finance industry... 

...except it doesn't.

Notarisation isn't a feature of blockchains, and has actually considered more of a 'bug' by most people with comprehension of the field. If you ask a bitcoin developer what the most pressing problem is with the blockchain, you're likely to hear that 'fungibility' is its biggest issue. Fungibility in this case being completely the opposite of regulatory oversight and reporting.

While the media are quick to herald the support of "big banks" in this new application of "blockchain technology", it would seem that most of these ~~con-men~~ entrepreneurs are doing what they normally do: start their own ~~scams~~ companies to sell ~~illegal securities~~ digital tokens.

However, unique to this year's discussion is the idea that tokens are bad, but that 'shares' in those peddling blockchains are good. What the difference is between shares and tokens remains murky, but this nuance aside, everyone wants to receive consulting as part of their investment.

If nothing else, the big winners in 2015 may remain those efforts which secured the most funding.


# Blockchain propaganda

I should point out that computerised settlement, notarisation and checksumming is an established industry that has never been hampered in its efficiency by anything other than regulation. These regulations are generally very efficient in normalising risks in the finance sector, and software in the field has performed precisely as well as the regulatory framework allows.

Efforts to enable a regulator's ability to inhibit company operations were previously kept to a minimum, though many in the field would now appear to want to change this arrangement.

In the hype period leading up to the current state of private blockchains, it was a common refrain that 'selling' the world on the notion of 'the technology behind bitcoin' would be the best way to demonstrate its utility.

Many of the newcomers in 2015 have taken this propaganda to heart, and, in doing so, left out the most important part: risk reduction in settlement amongst untrusted parties.

One would hope that the 'oracles' omitting this fact may end up bearing a lot of the blame when notarisation efforts fall short. Whether or not you believe bitcoin is a meme, it would appear that this segment of the market isn't being challenged by any of the newcomers.

Part of the pitch among those in the ~~inefficient accounting~~ distributed ledger space would lead us believe that computer databases were the reason why our transactions take so long to process. This extraordinary claim has been met with essentially zero resistance by many in the finance world, as the notion that "blockchains have won" has apparently preceded all understanding of what they're needed for.

But, at the end of 2015, such reasoning is just beginning to unravel.

Oddly, the incumbent consumer payment networks appear to be the first to understand the true purpose of blockchains.

American Express led the charge with a sizable round of funding for the innovative regulatory arbitrage company Abra. In close second came Visa with a very interesting (and seemingly well-considered) remittance proof-of-concept of its own.

And just recently, skepticism of the distributed ledger space was put forth by none other than Izabella Kaminska of the Financial Times, who wrote a short and impressive dismissal of this new industry in which the headline alone summarises it best:

# What does the future hold?

So what can we expect for blockchains in 2016?

New entrants to the blockchain space that seem to have best exploites the blockchain's efficiency would include Alphabay, a darknet marketplace; Nitrogen Sports, a bitcoin bookmaker; and the online gambling site BitKong.

Private blockchains certainly have a future in 2016. However, it's hard to find an industry (because there are none) whose notarisations aren't already well served by simple solutions like Google Docs.

In the world of blockchains it remains to be seen who, if anyone, will actually be making a profit in the consulting or distribution of private blockchain software. Furthermore, as this industry matures, incumbent industry players such as Oracle and IBM will likely 'flip the switch' and offer drop-in turn-key solutions of their own.

Private blockchains will be important – but not in the ways this 2015's evangelists have promised. Blockchains will likely increase pressure on regulators to reduce their cut as regulatory burdens in the settlement industry are rendered redundant.

The legacy of private blockchains may simply be that they sold regulators on the "idea of blockchains", allowing banks and payment processors to pursue new areas of profitability in the form of regulatory arbitrage...

...all without blockchains.
