As the Corona Virus rages throughout the world, countries have seen trillions of dollars wiped off their economic balance sheets. Companies have been ruined, and central banks have responded by frantically printing money to stave off further problems. In the US, they are proposing sending citizens thousand dollar stimulus cheques to get through this crisis.

Here’s the problem. The world has no way of dealing with international externalities. China refuses to deal with its wet markets, or run its labs responsibly. This virus is one of many that we regularly have to deal with that originates in China. The Chinese government refuses to address the unhealthy proximity of humans and animals in its agriculture and meat production industry and we have to deal with the fallout. We know that many of these animals harbour viruses that are just a few mutations away from transmission to humans.

In the right conditions, most of these problems can be averted. But when humans are eating raw bats, pangolins, or putting monkeys in cages while they are still alive, cutting open their heads, and munching on their brains... perhaps it is time to begin pointing fingers. When these viruses jump from animal to human and develop the ability to move from human to human, the result can be a pandemic. So far, China has gifted us MERS, SARS, and now COVID-19. All of these in successive, short order. Not to mention, the annual flu’s ambiguous origins and apparently persisent animal resevoir (100% absolutely definitely nothing to do with China).

Perhaps it’s time the UK charges China for these externalities. China has a lot of UK debt, billions of pounds of debt in fact.

So, why not create a new kind of debt instrument? The Externality Bond. These bonds are bills we issue to other nations. We issue them based on externalities. For example, what if China's policies force the UK spend £100 billion to stave off the effects of a health crisis? What if the NHS requires huge injections of cash as a result? No problem. We print £100 billion in Externality Bonds and put them in the "China account". Any debt China has purchased can be paid for with these bonds. Any debt that we owe China can be paid in these bonds. Any international agreement we make with China can use these bonds as negotiable instruments. You want to do business with the UK? Excellent. Let’s talk about how to pay off the remaining £100 billion you owe in Externality Bonds.

This plan is stupid and maybe it would destroy the Chinese economy. Perhaps it could take off and the whole world starts issuing these externality bonds. As far as I see it, it's no great stretch to say the Chinese government owes the UK for every pound spent sorting this shit out. In fact, the CCP owes money to every family that lost a loved one thanks to this disaster. And it’s not just us. It’s America, it's Italy, it's France, it's Australia, etc, etc, etc.

This is the reality. There is no use in dealing with a country whose evil regime is propped up by our own wealth. We all want things produced in China. The result? China gets rich, murders its own people, commits genocide against Muslims while harvesting their organs, and let’s its people live in a manner that makes them a petri dish for influenza, coronvirus and fuck knows what else. All of this is toletated so that we can have iPhones, TikTok, and WiFi on the London Underground. I say fuck that. Send them the bonds.
